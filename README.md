Welcome to the Music Box program! This project is an implementation of a Music Box application that allows users to manage albums and songs in a binary search tree (BST) data structure. Users can add, remove, and view details of albums, as well as add and remove songs within each album. The application is written in C language and provides a menu-driven interface for easy interaction.

## Features

- Add new albums to the Music Box with details like album title, release year, and singer's name.
- Remove albums from the Music Box by providing the album title.
- View a list of all albums present in the Music Box.
- View detailed information about a particular album, including its songs and other details.
- Add new songs to the song list of an existing album.
- Remove songs from the song list of an existing album.
